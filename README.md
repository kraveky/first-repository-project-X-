The main algorithm of the program is implemented in the bubble_sort function using nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the list n - 1 times, where n is the length of the list. The inner loop iterates over the list from the beginning to the n - i - 1 element, where i is the current iteration of the outer loop.

In each iteration of the inner loop, the program checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, the program swaps the two elements. This continues until the entire list is sorted. Finally, the program returns the sorted list.

The program also includes a test of the bubble_sort function using a sample list of numbers. The sorted list is printed to the console.
